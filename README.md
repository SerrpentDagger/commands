# Overview
Scajl is an easy-to-implement, easy-to-learn scripting language for developers that wish to expose arbitrary script capability to their users.
This guide is split into two parts: "Implementation," and "Scripting". Implementation describes how the app developer may implement Scajl into their program,
while Scripting describes how the end user may write scripts using the Scajl environment.
