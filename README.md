# Overview
Scajl (pronounced as 'scale') is an easy-to-implement, easy-to-learn scripting language for developers that wish to expose arbitrary script capability to their users. Utility functions are
provided in the library which use reflection to automatically expose Java methods, classes, and other structures into Scajl.


This guide is split into two parts: "Implementation," and "Scripting". Implementation describes how the app developer may implement Scajl into their program, while Scripting describes how the end user may write scripts using the Scajl environment exposed to them.

Note that the documentation is incomplete â€” a work in progress. It should still hopefully be useful to you, though.
