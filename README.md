# Overview
Scajl (pronounced as 'scale') is an easy-to-implement, easy-to-learn scripting language for developers that wish to expose arbitrary script capability to their users.

Scajl provides a lightweight framework for running script logic, as well as functions that expose custom structure to the script environment either explicitly or automatically. The automatic exposition is what sets Scajl apart from other languages — allowing script implementation of arbitrary Java logic with a single function call. *No longer must you painstakingly define each aspect of an object's data and conversions function-by-function!*

Excellent syntax highlighting can be achieved in Notepad++ with the use of the language file provided in the releases.


This guide is split into two parts: "Implementation," and "Scripting". Implementation describes how the app developer may implement Scajl into their program, while Scripting describes how the end user may write scripts using the Scajl environment exposed to them.

Note that the documentation is incomplete — a work in progress. It should still hopefully be useful to you, though.
