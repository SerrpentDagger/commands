# Scripting
## Syntax
Scajl is a command-based scripting language. The general syntax reflects this structure. An executable command is composed of a Head, and an Argument list. These can further be broken down.
### The Command Head
The command Head has three parts, in the following order:
- Execution modifier (optional): This can be used to alter how/when the command is run.
- Name (required): This is the name of the command to run.
- Storage (optional): This is where the result of the command will be stored.
